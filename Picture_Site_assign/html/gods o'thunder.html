        We complain too much about how people are attracted to westernised gods but ahbors<br>
        the 'original' african ones, the truth is our sense of packaging is mediocre.
    </p>
    <p>
        We're also lazy with our branding, western gods are branded well: intriguing gears<br>
         with fascinating backstories.
    </p>
    <p>
        We should at least admit we aren't doing some things rightly, we can start over again. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's present our òrìṣàs as approachable and less scary for a start.
    </p>
    <p>
        Popular legends paint them as unforgiving purnishers, and we're safe from their wraths <br>only if we renounce them.
