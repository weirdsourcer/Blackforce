        Mtchew! for a start, that gbẹ̀gìrì isn't even it, <br>
        too light!<br>
        Shows that the person that cooked it didn't boil<br>
        out the essense that formed the flavour of the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't let me start on the ewéédú sha,<br>
        everything hints at it being overcooked,<br>
        yet stale,<br>
        it is simply too thick to pass the grade in the<br>
        culinary school of ìbílẹ̀ delicacy that's worth it's star.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        And is that really àmàlà you're presenting to me<br>
        or an ẹbọ to the Òrìṣàs?<br>
        What was used to sieve the èlùbọ́ that went into the pot that<br>
        produced this abomination of a what-can-we-even-name-this?<br>
        A properly trained àmàlà stirer with half an eye would find<br>
        a million kókó in this thing! 
    </p>
    <p>
        This won't even pass the first test of swallow succulency<br>
        not to talk of the third test of àmàlà àti àbùlà gyration test.
