        You'll always fear women if you know how cunny women can be.

        My maternal grandfather was a good man. God bless his soul.<br>
        I remember when I was a kid and spent some holidays with him.<br>
        There was a lady  neighbor called Elizabeth around his age.
    </p>
    <p>
        She used to come to the house every now and then with a letter<br>
        from her brother in Australia, would ask my grandfather to read<br>
        and explain to her as she couldn't read. They will go to his room<br>
        to read the letter for her and after a bit, she comes out with a<br>
        red face and a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
        Few years later, as I grew older, we found out that Elizabeth <br>
        didn't have any brother in Australia and Grandpa was illiterate.<br>
